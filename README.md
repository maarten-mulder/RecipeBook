# RecipeBook
Angular application to store, maintain and modify recipes.

## Udemy Course
This application is built as I progress in the Angular course on Udemy. 
When I'm finished with the course, I will extend the application with features that me and my SO think are useful.

### Examples of these features are:
- Recipe randomizer to decide what we will eat the coming week.
- Be able to import recipes from applications like 'Appie', or popular recipe websites.
- ..Whatever we like and think of :-)

### Desired functionality
Since Angular apps can be ported to standalone android applications, this could be an easier solution than having to continuously run a server to sync up my and my SO's data. Obviously we need to sync up now and then, which is an interesting challenge from a development's perspective. 

If I decide to build a back-end in stead of porting this application to Android, I will build it with ASP.NET Core.
